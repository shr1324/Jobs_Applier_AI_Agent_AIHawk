PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE  
  
Working as A DevOps Engineer at CloudRaize IT services Pvt. Ltd. Since April 2021 – till present.  PROJECTS  1 
  
Project: GroupM Media, US. 
Organization: CloudRaize IT services Pvt.Ltd 
Role: Cloud DevOps Engineer  from May 2022 to Present 
Project Overview: Led the migration of legacy on-premise workloads, including Hadoop-based systems, to a scalable hybrid AWS–Azure cloud platform. The project involved implementing a real-time data pipeline for media analytics and building a secure, highly available platform to manage global digital ad campaigns. Leveraged cloud-native services, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure seamless delivery, cost optimization, and operational excellence across distributed teams. 
Roles & Responsibilities:  
•	Led the migration of legacy workloads and on-premise Hadoop clusters to a hybrid AWS– Azure cloud environment, ensuring minimal downtime, secure data transfer, and optimized cost utilization. 
•	Architected, implemented, and managed a secure, scalable, multi-cloud (AWS & Azure) infrastructure using Terraform (IaC), enabling environment reproducibility. 
•	Engineered and maintained end-to-end CI/CD pipelines (e.g Github actions/ azure devops and Argo CD) to automate build, test, security scanning, and deployment processes, achieving full automation from code commit to production. 
 
•	Containerized applications and managed their full lifecycle using Kubernetes (EKS & AKS), utilizing Helm charts for streamlined application packaging, versioning, and deployment. 
•	Configured and managed Kubernetes Ingress controllers and cloud-native Load Balancers (AWS ALB/NLB, Azure Application Gateway) to ensure efficient traffic routing, high availability, and scalability of microservices. 
 
•	Implemented Blue-Green and canary deployment strategies within Kubernetes to achieve zerodowntime releases, minimize deployment risk, and enable instant rollback capabilities. 
•	Designed and tested Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies for critical services, including configuring cross-region replication for databases and failover mechanisms for global load balancers. 
•	Fine-tuned Kubernetes cluster performance by implementing Horizontal Pod Autoscalers 
(HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscalers (VPA), and configuring resource requests/limits to maximize resource utilization. 
•	Integrated SonarQube for static code analysis and Trivy for container vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline, enforcing quality gates and enhancing software security posture. 
•	Designed and deployed monitoring solutions using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for building comprehensive dashboards, providing real-time visibility into application performance and infrastructure health. 
 
•	Developed and utilized Python and Bash scripts to automate routine operational tasks, custom monitoring checks, and environment validation processes. 
•	Secured sensitive application data by integrating AWS Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault with Kubernetes pods and application runtimes, eliminating hard-coded credentials. 
 
•	Implemented serverless architectures using Azure Functions and automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps to process events and integrate services without managing server infrastructure. 
•	Managed Kubernetes upgrades with a meticulous plan-for-failure approach, ensuring cluster stability and maintaining compliance with supported versions. 
 
•	Achieved significant cost savings by leveraging cloud Cost Optimization tools (AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management + Advisor) to identify underutilized resources, implement right-sizing recommendations, and commit to reserved instances.
